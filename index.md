## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 3, part-1
This was a fun lab assignment and it helped me learn how to do unit conversions
in C++. Also this was the first time using double as our data type of choice
for this lab. By using doubles, it helped convert a  measurement of volume from
milliliters in the metric system, to various units in the US customary system,
and overall a great lab that introduces us to doubles. 

Lab 9, part-2
This was my second favorite lab since we used the file I/O to make a secret
number hidden from the player. I enjoy making these secret number games since
they are fun to make. Also compared to other secret number games we made from
the past labs, this one stood out since we used a file I/O instead of just if
statements, which makes it so much better.

Lab 12
This lab was by far my favorite since we started creating colored images with
animation or text. By using the three channels; red, green, and blue, we were
able to create our animated gif. By working with images, conditions, functions,
and loops we were able to create the second image for part-1 and overall a
great last lab.
